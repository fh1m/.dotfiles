A cyberpunk desktop shell for Hyprland, with a bar, a full-screen deck and a
PAM lockscreen.

*The desktop: kitty and Thunar under the bar, in the Circuit profile.*

## Install

On Arch Linux with Hyprland, run as yourself (not as root):

    bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bowenbride/wrayth/main/install.sh)

It installs everything Wrayth needs, backs up any existing Hyprland config
before changing it, and asks for sudo only to install packages. Then log out
and back in.

See [what the installer does](#install-details) and how to
[read it before running it](#read-it-first). Check the
[requirements](#requirements) first.

## Features

A desktop shell for [Hyprland](https://hyprland.org), built with
[Quickshell](https://quickshell.org). It has a top bar and a full-screen
**deck**: a terminal, system diagnostics, a daily planner and a vulnerability
watch. It also has dropdowns for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and power profiles, a
launcher, a power menu, a PAM lockscreen, notifications, and six colour
profiles, with custom profiles too.

Wrayth was designed by [bowenbride](https://github.com/bowenbride) and built
with help from AI. It is a personal project, released in case it is useful to
someone else. See [Issues](#issues).

**The bar**

- Workspaces, and a scrolling ticker of firewall, profile, failed-service and
  vulnerability status.
- CPU, memory, network traffic, Bluetooth and power readouts.
- A keep-awake toggle that pauses idle locking.
- An unread-messages marker, which shows only that something is waiting and
  never reads the message.
- A clock with seconds and the date.

**The deck** (`Super + E`)

- A kitty terminal with a fastfetch banner in the profile's colours.
- SYS.DIAG: host, uplink, per-thread CPU bars, load, temperature, frequency,
  memory and a network graph.
- Daemons: small probes you choose from a library of 20. They cover network
  (ping, DNS, VPN, open ports), security (firewall, failed logins, SSH,
  USB, microphone and camera) and system (battery wear, disk, clock sync,
  pending reboot).
- The planner: a daily list of tagged tasks, edited in place.
- VULN WATCH: `arch-audit` results by severity, linked to the Arch security
  tracker.
- SIGNAL: a live audio spectrum from `cava`.

**Profiles**

- Six preset colour profiles, applied to the shell, kitty, Hyprland's borders
  and the terminal logo.
- A live-preview picker, and custom profiles made from nine colours. Open the
  picker from the deck: see [Finding your way around](#finding-your-way-around).
- A matching wallpaper for every profile, generated locally for custom ones.
- Wallpaper pools: a set of your own wallpapers for each profile.

**The lockscreen** (`Super + L`)

- PAM authentication with a visible lockout countdown.
- No unauthenticated unlock, and it recovers by itself if its process dies.

**Effects**

- Six scanline treatments, on panels only or on everything.
- Occasional glitch effects on a schedule you set, or off.

**Everything else**

- Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, power-profile and identity dropdowns from the bar.
- A launcher (tap `Super`) for apps and profiles, listing your most-used
  first.
- Notifications, and an on-screen display for volume and brightness.
- A power menu: lock, sleep, log out, reboot and power off.

## Keybinds

Wrayth's own keys, from `external/hypr-wrayth.lua`:

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `Super` (tap) | launcher |
| `Super + E` | open or close the deck |
| `Super + Shift + E` | refresh the deck terminal |
| `Super + P` | power menu |
| `Super + L` | lock the screen |
| `Super + 1` … `0` | go to workspace 1–10 (closes the deck first) |
| brightness keys | brightness ±5% |
| volume keys, mute | volume |

Wrayth's keys replace any earlier bind on the same key, so no key does two
things. `external/hypridle.conf` locks the screen on idle and before sleep.
The everyday [window keys](#window-keys) come with Wrayth's complete Hyprland
config. Some things, like the profile picker, have no key; see
[Finding your way around](#finding-your-way-around).

## Finding your way around

Much of Wrayth opens by clicking a label rather than a button. These are the
ones that are easy to miss.

**The profile picker** has no keybind. There are two ways in:

- Press `Super + E` to open the deck, then click `PROFILE // <NAME>` in the
  SYS.DIAG panel (top right). This opens the picker.
- Or tap `Super` for the launcher and type a profile's name. This applies the
  profile directly, without the picker.

**Inside the picker:**

- Click a card, or use the arrow keys, to preview a profile live.
- Click the same card again, press `Enter` or press `APPLY` to keep it.
- `Escape` or `REVERT AND CLOSE` closes the picker and undoes the preview.
- `+ NEW CUSTOM` (the last card) makes a custom profile.
- Custom profiles have edit and delete buttons on their card; presets don't.
  `Delete` also removes the selected custom profile after asking.
- **EFFECTS** (scanlines and glitches) is a button in the picker.
- **Wallpapers** are in the picker's wallpaper column: `DYNAMIC` or `STATIC`,
  the folder, and `MANAGE WALLPAPER POOLS`.
- In a sub-screen (the editor, effects or pools), `Escape` goes back one step.

**The bar.** Most readouts open something when clicked:

| Click | Opens |
| --- | --- |
| the ID block at the far left (e.g. `AB//01`) | the identity editor: set both halves (two letters or digits each) |
| a workspace number | that workspace |
| the network readout | the Wi-Fi dropdown (networks, then `WI-FI SETTINGS`) |
| the Bluetooth readout | the Bluetooth dropdown (devices, `DISCOVERY`) |
| `PWR` | the power-profile dropdown |
| `IDLE // AUTO` / `IDLE // HOLD` | toggles keep-awake: `HOLD` stops idle locking |
| the message icon | the `communication` special workspace (see below) |
| empty bar space, or `Escape` | closes an open dropdown |

The message icon only appears while Discord, Vesktop, WebCord or Equibop is
running, and shows only that something is unread. Clicking it toggles a
Hyprland special workspace named `communication`. Wrayth doesn't move your
chat client there, so add a window rule if you want this to work.

**The deck** (`Super + E`):

- **Daemons:** click the `DAEMONS // LOADED` heading in SYS.DIAG to open the
  library, and tick up to five to show. Click a daemon's row to expand its
  details. The PING daemon's details let you choose which city it measures.
- **Planner:**
  - `+ ADD GIG` at the bottom adds a task;
  - the tickbox marks a task done;
  - click a task's name to rename or retag it;
  - drag the grip on the left to reorder;
  - the minus on the right removes a task.

  The planner is also a plain text file, `~/.config/wrayth/planner.txt`,
  which you can edit by hand.
- **VULN WATCH:** click a package to expand it.
  - `OPEN ADVISORY` opens the Arch security tracker's page.
  - `FIX` runs a full system update (`sudo pacman -Syu`) in a terminal, when a
    fixed version exists.
  - `REMOVE` uninstalls the package in a terminal, with pacman's own prompt.
    It's only offered when nothing depends on the package.
  - `SWEEP` re-runs the audit.

**The power menu** (`Super + P`): use the arrow keys and `Enter`, or press the
letter shown on a tile. Reboot and power off need a second press to confirm.
`Escape` cancels that confirmation first, and a second `Escape` closes the
menu.

**The lockscreen:** type your password and press `Enter`. `Escape` clears
what you've typed.

## Requirements

- **Arch Linux** (or an Arch-based distro). The package count, the update
  check and the vulnerability watch use `pacman`, `checkupdates` and
  `arch-audit`. Elsewhere those readouts are blank, but the rest of the shell
  runs. Wrayth is built and tested only on Arch.
- **Hyprland 0.56 or newer, with the Lua config** (`hyprland.lua`). Wrayth's
  rules and keys are written in Hyprland's `hl.*` Lua API. A `hyprland.conf`
  setup is not edited in place. The installer replaces it with Wrayth's
  complete Lua config instead, after backing it up.
- **Quickshell 0.3.1 or newer** (`quickshell` in `extra`). The installer
  installs it for you.
- **A screen of at least 1920×1080 logical pixels.** The deck is laid out for
  1080p. On shorter screens it is clipped, not reflowed, and Wrayth shows a
  one-time notice.
  - **High-resolution screens may look small.** Wrayth's complete Hyprland
    config runs every monitor at scale 1, so on a 1440p or 4K screen
    everything is drawn at 1080p pixel sizes. To make it larger, raise
    `scale` in the `hl.monitor` block of `~/.config/hypr/hyprland.lua`. Keep
    at least 1920×1080 logical pixels: on a 4K screen, scale 2 gives exactly
    that.

## Install details

One command, run as yourself (not as root):

    bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bowenbride/wrayth/main/install.sh)

### Read it first

**Prefer to read it first?** Clone the repository, read the installer, then
run it from the clone:

    git clone https://github.com/bowenbride/wrayth.git ~/wrayth-src
    less ~/wrayth-src/install.sh
    bash ~/wrayth-src/install.sh --source ~/wrayth-src

### After installing

Log out and back in to Hyprland. On a text console, log in and type
`start-hyprland`. The installer asks nothing it does not have to, and there is
nothing to edit afterwards.

What the installer does:

1. **Installs missing packages** from the official Arch repositories. It
   prints one `sudo pacman -S --needed ...` command, then runs it. That is the
   only step that runs as root, and sudo asks for your password.
2. **Fetches Wrayth** into `~/.config/quickshell/wrayth`, from this
   repository or from `--source`. Nothing else is downloaded.
3. **Sets up the rest as you:**
   - the `wrayth-*` helpers in `~/.local/bin`;
   - the kitty and hypridle configs;
   - the bundled Chakra Petch font;
   - the six profile wallpapers in `~/Pictures/wallpapers/wrayth`;
   - one line in `~/.bashrc`;
   - Hyprland. With no config of your own, only Hyprland's generated default,
     or an old `hyprland.conf`, it installs Wrayth's complete setup and first
     moves whatever was in `~/.config/hypr` to a dated backup. With your own
     `hyprland.lua`, it backs that file up and adds one line that loads Wrayth.

Every file it replaces is backed up first, and the closing summary says where.
Running it again updates Wrayth and changes nothing else.

### Optional packages

Each of these features degrades gracefully without its package:

    sudo pacman -S --needed cava fastfetch pacman-contrib arch-audit \
        brightnessctl power-profiles-daemon bluez bluez-utils hypridle ufw xdg-utils

| Package | Powers | Without it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `cava` | the SIGNAL spectrum | a flat spectrum |
| `fastfetch` | the deck terminal's banner | a plain shell |
| `pacman-contrib` | the update count | PKG reads 0 |
| `arch-audit` | the VULN WATCH panel | `NOT INSTALLED` |
| `brightnessctl` | brightness keys | no brightness control |
| `power-profiles-daemon` | the power-profile readout and switch | blank |
| `bluez`, `bluez-utils` | the Bluetooth dropdown | no Bluetooth |
| `hypridle` | lock on idle and before sleep | no automatic lock |
| a firewall (`ufw`, `nftables`, `firewalld`) | the SHIELD readout | `NOT CONFIGURED` |
| `xdg-utils` | opening the wallpaper folder | the button does nothing |

## Profiles

A profile sets every colour in the shell. Kitty, the Hyprland borders, the
deck's logo and the wallpaper follow it.

| Profile | Character |
| --- | --- |
| **Circuit** | the balanced default: red and teal |
| **Sodium** | streetlight yellow on warm grime |
| **Prism** | magenta and cyan on violet-black |
| **Redline** | chrome and red on black |
| **Oxide** | rust and amber |
| **Cobalt** | cold blue on midnight steel |

To open the **profile picker**, press `Super + E` for the deck, then click
`PROFILE // <NAME>` in the SYS.DIAG panel. Profiles are also listed in the
launcher. Click a card to preview it live, and click again or press `APPLY`
to keep it. `REVERT AND CLOSE` undoes a preview.

**Custom profiles.** In the picker, choose `+ NEW CUSTOM`. You set nine
colours: ground, panel, hair, text, bright, dim, signal, accent and alert.
Wrayth derives the rest the same way the presets do. A custom profile's
wallpaper is the Circuit wallpaper recoloured to its accent and signal. This
is done locally with a colour lookup table, with no network and no generative
model. Custom profiles are saved in `~/.config/wrayth/custom-profiles.json`.

**Wallpapers.** By default a profile switch changes the wallpaper too
(`DYNAMIC`). Switch it to `STATIC` in the picker's wallpaper column to keep one
wallpaper throughout. The folder defaults to `~/Pictures/wallpapers`.

## Window keys

Window keys, from Wrayth's complete Hyprland config (`external/hyprland.lua`,
installed only when you had no config of your own):

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `Super + Q` | open kitty |
| `Super + C` | close the window |
| `Super + V` | float or tile the window |
| `Super + F` | fullscreen |
| `Super + J` | toggle the split direction |
| `Super + arrows` | move focus |
| `Super + Shift + 1` … `0` | move the window to a workspace |
| `Super` + left drag / right drag | move / resize a window |
| `Super` + scroll | next / previous workspace |
| `Super + Shift + M` | exit Hyprland |

## Effects

Open the profile picker and choose **EFFECTS**. Settings are saved in
`~/.config/wrayth/effects.json`.

**Scanlines**

- **Treatment:** `NONE`, `FINE FAINT`, `FINE STRONGER`, `WIDE`,
  `FINE + ROLLING BAND` or `FULL CRT`.
- **Coverage:** `PANELS ONLY` or `EVERYTHING`.
- **With `EVERYTHING`**, you can also turn on:
  - `EXCLUDE WINDOW CONTENT`, which keeps the lines off your apps;
  - `EXCLUDE FULLSCREEN`, which removes them over fullscreen windows.

The rolling band and full CRT cost a little more GPU time than plain lines, and
`EVERYTHING` costs more than `PANELS ONLY`.

**Glitches.** These are brief interference effects on the shell's surfaces.

| Setting | Interval |
| --- | --- |
| `OFF` | none |
| `RARE` | a random interval of 60–180 s |
| `NORMAL` | a random interval of 30–90 s (the default) |
| `CUSTOM` | a random range (`FROM`/`TO`) or a fixed interval (`EVERY`), 2–3600 s |

You can also choose which effects are in the pool, and how many play per
glitch.

## Security

**The lockscreen** uses Wayland's `ext-session-lock` protocol. It checks your
password with PAM, using Wrayth's own PAM stack in `assets/pam.d/passwd`:
`pam_faillock` around `pam_unix`. Nothing is installed under `/etc`.

- There is **no unauthenticated unlock**: no IPC command, no logind hook and no
  recovery tool can open the session. The only way in is your password.
- If the lockscreen process dies, the compositor keeps the session locked.
  Wrayth's supervisor starts a new lockscreen, which takes the lock over.
- PAM runs in a separate process, so a slow or hung PAM check cannot freeze the
  lockscreen.

**Threat model.** The lockscreen protects your session from someone at the
keyboard and from other users of the same machine. It cannot protect you from
software already running as you, and no screen locker can: such a program can
read your files and could end or replace any lock client. Wrayth turns on
Hyprland's `misc:allow_session_lock_restore` so a crashed lockscreen can be
replaced. That option only lets a new lockscreen take over a held lock and
never unlocks one. Any program running as you could turn it on anyway.

**Failed passwords lock your whole account.** After three wrong passwords in a
row, `pam_faillock` locks your account for ten minutes (by default,
`deny=3` and `unlock_time=600`). The lockout is per account, not per program.
While it lasts, `sudo` and console logins refuse your *correct* password too.
The lockscreen shows `ACCOUNT LOCKED // RETRY IN m:ss` and does not send
passwords to PAM during the countdown. Wait it out **without typing passwords
anywhere**, because every wrong attempt can restart the ten minutes.

**Everything else:**

- The deck's kitty remote-control socket is private to you.
- Untrusted text such as notifications, Wi-Fi names and advisories is shown as
  plain text, never as markup.
- Wrayth's folders are owner-only.
- The shell's own network traffic is:
  - the PING readout, which measures latency to a cloud endpoint you choose
    (default: AWS `us-east-1`);
  - a ping to your router for the uplink readout;
  - `checkupdates` and `arch-audit` if they are installed.

  The installer contacts only this repository and pacman's mirrors.

## Recovering a stuck lockscreen

None of the steps below adds a password-free way in. Each ends with you typing
your password on a Wrayth lockscreen, or with the session ending.

**Usually there is nothing to do.**

- **After switching to a text console and back** (`Ctrl+Alt+F3`, then
  `Ctrl+Alt+F1`), the lockscreen accepts typing again within about a second.
- **If the lockscreen process dies**, a new one starts within a second. For
  that second you may see Hyprland's own "lock screen app died" screen. This is
  expected: the session stays locked the whole time.
- If the lockscreen cannot get the keyboard back after three tries, it shows
  **KEYBOARD LOST // RECOVER FROM A CONSOLE**.

**If it is still stuck:**

1. Press `Ctrl+Alt+F3` and log in with your username and password.
2. Run:

        ~/.local/bin/wrayth-recover

   It restarts the shell, and the new shell takes the lock back. When it
   reports `wrayth has taken the lock back`, it tells you which key returns you
   to the desktop, usually `Ctrl+Alt+F1`.
3. Press that key and type your password. Your windows are all still there.

**Last resort: end the session.** This **closes every window and loses
anything unsaved.** Use it only if `wrayth-recover` says it could not recover.
On the text console:

1. Run `loginctl list-sessions`. Find the row whose **TTY** is your desktop's
   console (usually `tty1`) and note its **SESSION** number.
2. Run `sudo loginctl terminate-session NUMBER`, with that number.
3. Press `Ctrl+Alt+F1` and log in again.

## Uninstalling

    ~/.config/quickshell/wrayth/install.sh --uninstall

This removes what the installer added:

- the helper links;
- the font;
- its line in `~/.bashrc`;
- its line in your `hyprland.lua`, or its complete Hyprland config, which is
  moved aside rather than deleted.

It then offers to put back everything it backed up. Packages are left
installed. It also leaves your Wrayth data and the checkout in place. To remove
those too:

    rm -rf ~/.config/quickshell/wrayth ~/.config/wrayth \
           ~/.cache/wrayth ~/.local/state/wrayth

## Known limitations

- Arch Linux only for the package, update and vulnerability readouts.
- Hyprland with the Lua config only.
- The deck targets 1920×1080 or larger. Smaller screens are clipped, not
  reflowed.
- CPU temperature needs an Intel `coretemp`, AMD `k10temp`/`zenpower` or ARM
  `cpu_thermal` sensor. Without one, no temperature is shown.
