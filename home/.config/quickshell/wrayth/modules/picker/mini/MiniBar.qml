// The top bar, drawn small, in a palette that is not necessarily the one the

// than from `Theme`, which is the whole point: eight of these sit on the
// picker at once, each showing what its own profile would look like.
//
// It is drawn rather than captured. A live copy of the real bar would need
// eight more of every service behind it; the shapes and the palette are what
// the card is answering, and those cost nothing per frame.

// **Every figure here is authored at the size it is drawn.** It used to be
// authored at 1/1.35 and scaled up by a transform, which rasterised 7 px type
// and then magnified it -- inside the thumbnail's chamfer layer, so the
// magnification happened to an already-flattened texture. It measured the
// right size and could not be read. Nothing in this shell is drawn small and
// scaled up.
