-- wrayth -- standalone Hyprland integration.
--
-- Everything Hyprland needs to run the wrayth shell: the layer and window
-- rules, the animation curve and decoration the shell was designed against,
-- the start-up hook, and a set of keybinds. **It depends on nothing defined
-- anywhere else** -- no curve, variable, colour, monitor name or script outside
-- this file and wrayth's own checkout -- so it loads on a bare Hyprland config
-- with zero errors (checked with `Hyprland --verify-config`).
--
-- install.sh places it at ~/.config/hypr/hypr-wrayth.lua and loads it for you
-- -- either inside the complete config it installs, or by adding one line,
-- `require("hypr-wrayth")`, to the end of your own hyprland.lua. Nothing needs
-- to be edited by hand. `./install.sh --uninstall` takes it out again.
--
-- It uses Hyprland's Lua config provider (the `hl` global, Hyprland 0.56+).
--
-- **Its keys replace any earlier bind on the same key.** Hyprland runs every
-- action bound to a key, so a key bound here and in your own config would do
-- both (Super + E opening a file manager *and* the deck). Each key below is
-- unbound first, so wrayth's action is the only one. Change the keys freely.

-- ===========================================================================
-- Layer rules -- the shell's surfaces
-- ===========================================================================

-- Every wrayth surface that comes and goes fades as one unit, blur included,
-- rather than sliding -- which is what stops blurred rectangles arriving from a
-- screen edge or lingering after their content is gone. QML never fades these
-- surfaces itself; that would double the fade.
hl.layer_rule({
    match     = { namespace = "wrayth-(bar|deck|deckbg|popup|overlay|notifications)" },
    animation = "fade",
})

-- The daily-driver profile keeps these surfaces opaque and unblurred.
hl.layer_rule({
    match        = { namespace = "wrayth-(bar|deck|deckbg|popup|overlay|notifications)" },
    blur         = false,
})

-- The wallpaper layer is opaque and must not fade on a profile change (the
-- shell crossfades the image itself), so it is outside both rules above.
hl.layer_rule({
    match   = { namespace = "wrayth-background" },
    no_anim = true,
})

-- ===========================================================================
-- The deck -- a special workspace holding the wrayth-deck kitty window
-- ===========================================================================

-- The deck terminal floats on its own special workspace; the shell sizes and
-- moves it, because a window rule is evaluated in raw monitor coordinates and
-- cannot see the area the bar reserves.
-- `silent`, so the terminal opening at login does not bring the deck up with
-- it: the deck stays closed until Super + E.
--
-- `size` and `move` put it in its slot from the moment it opens -- the exact
-- slot on a 1920 x 1080 screen, a whole number of kitty cells wide. The shell
-- then places it precisely for whatever screen it is on (and again whenever
-- the layout changes), deck open or not; these only make sure it never
-- appears anywhere else first.
hl.window_rule({
    match     = { class = "wrayth-deck" },
    float     = true,
    workspace = "special:deck silent",
    size      = "1422 690",
    move      = "25 69",
})

-- kitty asks for activation when its screen is cleared; with focus-on-activate
-- on, that would pop the deck open on every profile change (which reprints the
-- greeting). Off, only Super + E opens it.
hl.window_rule({
    match             = { class = "wrayth-deck" },
    focus_on_activate = false,
})

-- The deck terminal's frame matches the panels beside it: a 1 px border, the
-- colour set per profile by ~/.local/bin/wrayth-profile.
hl.window_rule({
    match       = { class = "wrayth-deck" },
    border_size = 1,
})

-- No gaps or shadow around the deck terminal: the shell's layout is the layout.

-- gently -- the same shape the deck was designed and measured against.
hl.curve("wraythDeck", { type = "bezier", points = { { 0.05, 0.7 }, { 0.1, 1 } } })

-- The deck fades as one thing. The panels are layer surfaces forced to `fade`
-- by the layer rule; the terminal is a window on the special workspace. Both
-- run at speed 4 (400 ms) on the same curve, so they arrive together rather
-- than in two pieces.

-- ===========================================================================
-- Decoration -- what the deck terminal needs to match the panels
-- ===========================================================================
-- These are global (they affect every window). rounding_power = 1 turns
-- Hyprland's rounded corners into straight cuts, and rounding = 34 makes the
-- cut's leg 16 px -- the same chamfer the shell's own panels cut -- so a window
-- corner and a panel corner beside it are the same shape. blur.special frosts
-- the whole background behind the deck (so the deck draws no backdrop of its
-- own), and dim_special darkens it. Adjust to taste, but the deck terminal
-- expects rounding_power = 1 and rounding = 34.
hl.config({
    decoration = {
        dim_special    = 0.38,
        blur           = {

-- ===========================================================================
-- The lockscreen may be restarted into a held lock
-- ===========================================================================
-- If the lockscreen's process dies while the screen is locked, Hyprland keeps
-- the session locked and shows its own "lock screen app died" screen. This lets
-- a new wrayth lockscreen take that lock over (wrayth-shell starts one at once,
-- and wrayth-recover does it from a text console), so getting back in is typing
-- your password, not ending the session. It never unlocks anything: the new
-- lockscreen still needs your password. See DESIGN.md, Security.
--
-- `session_lock_xray` keeps Hyprland drawing the desktop *behind* the lock
-- surface, which the lock surface covers opaquely until the password is
-- accepted; the unlock then dissolves onto the live desktop instead of onto
-- black. The surface is only ever transparent during that exit fade, after
-- authentication (see modules/lock/LockScreen.qml and DESIGN.md, Security).
