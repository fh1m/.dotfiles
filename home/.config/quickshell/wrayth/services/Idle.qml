// IDLE // AUTO or IDLE // HOLD, and the one thing that decides it.
//
// **It is persisted, and that is the whole point of this file.** The flag used
// to live on `ShellState`, which is rebuilt from scratch by every config
// reload -- and the shell reloads whenever any of its files changes, which
// during a build session is constantly. HOLD would be set, the shell would
// reload for an unrelated reason, and the machine would lock ten minutes
// later with the bar still reading HOLD on the previous frame. Measured: set
// HOLD, touch one file, and the state came back AUTO.
//
// The inhibitor itself is held by the bar window -- see `Bar.qml`. This only
// says whether it should be.
