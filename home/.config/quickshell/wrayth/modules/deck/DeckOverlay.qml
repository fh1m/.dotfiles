// The deck: one surface, one blur.
//
// A single backdrop covers the whole working area and is frosted by Hyprland as
// one region, with the four widgets drawn translucent on top of it. They have no
// blur of their own, so there are no per-panel frosted rectangles and no
// chamfer edges cut out of the frosting.
//
// The one gap is the deck terminal's slot. The terminal is a Hyprland *window*,
// and every Top layer surface draws over every window, so the backdrop leaves
// that rectangle transparent for it to show through. `ignore_alpha` on the
// namespace keeps the gap unfrosted; the terminal supplies its own translucency
// and Hyprland blurs behind it like any other window.
//
// Nothing here fades in QML. The `animation = fade` layer rule fades the whole
// surface, blur included, so it cannot slide in from an edge or leave frosting
// behind on the way out.
